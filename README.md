# ecommerce_app

I finished a beginner course in Flutter with Dart a few weeks ago and I thought it would be a good idea to have a repo about the e-commerce app I made towards the end of the beginer course.

It is a fairly simple app and I really like Formula 1 so the app is related to it.
It works on web, and android. I haven't tested it on iOS or any desktop apps yet.
